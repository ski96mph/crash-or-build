                <div class="text_body">
                    <p>There's not a whole lot I'm willing to write about this one, so my apologies for that. There are no WIP photos. There was almost no iteration during the build process. It's a very simple build so it just came together as I imagined it would. System brick laying is easy in that way compared to my usual techniques. One hurdle that I didn't predict was the right/left balance being a problem because the angel leg attached to the base isn't quite centered between the wings, meaning it usually requires a big block of bricks attached to the back of the left wing to maintain neutral balance.</p>

                    <p>It's a sincere build, but the metaphor is heavy-handed and the two most eye catching aspects are techniques ripped from others, those being the wings (kinda) from Woomy's <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/woomyworld/53745803208/" target="_blank">Virgo dragon</a> and the <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=32607#T=C" target="_blank">threaves</a>-on-nets from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/127157515@N07/52980938389" target="_blank">MSEP</a>.</p>
     
                    <p>As for how it fits into my broader creative/technical canvas: From a technical standpoint there were two things that I was interested in. 1) thematically the build is all about transitions - metaphorical, material, and color - with color being the one most interesting to me as this kind of dithering color transition wasn't something I had tackled before (I had already built incorporating material transitions). 2) the cantilevered angel with all that weight hanging out over open air, which required a very sturdy technic into brick construction, building on my experience with Sagittarius. And that's all there is to it.</p>
